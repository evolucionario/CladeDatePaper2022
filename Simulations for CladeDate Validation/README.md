###Instructions for running the simulations:

1. copy all files to local directory (e.g. `/dir`)

2. Open `R` and set the working directory with `setwd("/dir")`

3. Run scripts in the file `Simulation of Datasets.R` to generate phylogenetic trees, DNA sequences, and fossil records.

4. Run scripts in the file `Simulation CladeDate with Chronos.R` for calibrating phylogenetic trees using CladeDate and plotting results.

5. Run scripts in the file `Simulation for CladeAge Analysis.R` to create a dataset to be analyzed with CladeAge and CladeDate.
