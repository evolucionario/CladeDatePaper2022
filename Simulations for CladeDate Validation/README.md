###Instructions for running the simulations:

1. copy all files to local directory (e.g. `/dir`)

2. Open `R` and set the working directory with `setwd("/dir")`

3. Run scripts in file `Simulation of Datasets.R` to generate phylogenetic trees, DNA sequences, and fossil records.

4. Run scripts in file `Simulation CladeDate with Chronos.R` to time-calibrate phylogenetic trees using CladeDate and plott results.

5. Run scripts in file `Simulation for CladeAge Analysis.R` to create datasets to be analyzed with CladeAge and CladeDate and compare results. Run `xml` files in `BEAST2` to obtain results based on CladeAge.
